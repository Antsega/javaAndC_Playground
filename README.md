<br>
I would like to track my progress, as I continue to grow as developer.<br> 
As the years continue to go by, I can very easily go back to my work and see how my project's complexity,<br>

I am currently unsure how cloning a project written in BlueJ would conflict with VSC or IntelliJ; you have been warned.
